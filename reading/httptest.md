# [HTTP TEST](https://gist.github.com/sonya/e1fc0d40ffaf6be2227302949478ce65#file-httptest_test-go)



A pure example why code isn't fun anymore. Look at this example that appear in the first google search [poor fake request](https://www.thegreatcodeadventure.com/mocking-http-requests-in-golang/). I'm not saying that is wrong, but at least for me, it's clear that it's a over engineer around a thing that should be easy to implement: a fake request to avoid external dependencies into my unit tests

in the end the standard library provide e really nice way to do that +_+
