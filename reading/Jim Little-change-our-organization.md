[Change Your Organization (For Peons)](https://web.archive.org/web/20130721011202/http://agile2003.agilealliance.org/files/R1Paper.pdf)

A lot of concerns about what a simple peon can do in their company to move enginner forward. Amongst them

In this experience report, a programmer at a
medium-sized software company explains his tactics for
bottom-up organizational change

2. Change Is Hard

## Change Tactic #1: Establish an escape route.
Determine how you can successfully get out, whether that
means finding another job, going back to your old duties,
or something else. Think about how and why you would
make your escape.

## Change Tactic #2: Have a solid support network.
Bottom-up change is frustrating and thankless. Be sure
that your happiness isn’t dependent on job satisfaction.
Rely on family and friends, go home on time, and don’t
dwell on work problems away from work

## Change Tactic #3: Find small pleasures.
Organizational change is largely outside of your control.
Find small things at work that you can do every day that
are in your control and that give you a feeling of
satisfaction.

## Change Tactic #4: Don’t give up. I made very little
difference to the way things were done in the beginning,
but my efforts slowly changed the way people thought
about problems. This change was largely invisible… but
one day, it passed some threshold, and I had multilateral
support for a big change

# 3. How to Get Them to Listen to You

## Change Tactic #5: Respect is your currency. The
more people respect you, the more credibility you have.
The more credibility you have, the more opportunities
you’ll have to change their opinions. Earn respect by
your actions.

## Change Tactic #6: Be respectful. Don’t ever look
down at anybody, no matter what, not even in the privacy
of your thoughts. People can tell. A differing opinion
does not mean ignorance, and ignorance does not mean
stupidity.

## Change Tactic #7: Do your work. You weren’t
hired to change the organization. Do—no, excel at—the
work you were hired to do. You’ll impress people with
your dedication to the job and you’ll earn respect.

## Change Tactic #8: Stay within your sphere of
influence. Don’t try to change parts of the organization
you don’t have continual contact with.
