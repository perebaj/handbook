# [Measuring developer productivity? A response to McKinsey](https://tidyfirst.substack.com/p/measuring-developer-productivity)

## Who is this article for?

```
We wrote this article for software developers and engineering leaders, and anybody who cares about nurturing high-performing software development teams. By “high performing” we mean teams where developers satisfy their customers, feel good about coming to work, and don’t feel like they’re constantly measured on senseless metrics which work against building software that solves customers’ problems. Our goal is to help hands-on leaders to make suggestions for measuring without causing harm, and to help software developers become more productive.

## How does software delivery value?

Creating -> Shipping -> Iterating over it

This flow englobes the **effort** related to planning, coding, testing and so on. Based on that, you have the **output**, which is the result of the effort, probably a feature, a bug fix, etc. After that, the **outcome** is the perception of the output by the customer. And finally, the **impact**, that is the sum of all.

## who can benefit from these analyzes?

1. C-level that want to know who should be fired or promoted
    If you don't have good metrics to support this decision, usually the metrics that will be used are:

    1.1. Performance based on performance reviews
    1.2. last in first out
    1.3. Number of codes produced
    1.4 Ask the manager

2. Create better arrangements for the team
3. To manage performance and reward
4. Swr that want to self-improve
    I'm here, but how can I improve?

    4.1 Have just one red test
    4.2 Set a PR goal/merge goal

## People GAME the system for their own benefit!

## Individual x Team
