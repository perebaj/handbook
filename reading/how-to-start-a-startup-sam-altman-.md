# [How to start a startup - Sam Altman, Dustin Moskovitz](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CBYhVcO4WgI&list=PL5q_lef6zVkaTY_cT1k7qFNF2TidHCe-1)

# Part 1 - Sam Altman

The backbone of any startup that should be strictly implemented are:

- Great Idea
- Great Product
- Team
- Execution

You just need to open a startup if you are compelled that you can solve a specific problem, if the only reason is to be rich, there are other ways to achieve it


## The idea 

The definition is extensive, it includes the size and the growth of the market, the growth strategy for the company, the defensibility strategy, and so on.

Build a business that is hard to replicate

If you don't love what you are building, you will probably give up at some point; God startups usually take ten years.

One common mistake of Fouders is that they belief that the first version of their product needs to sound very big, but it doesn't, you need to take over a small specific market and expand from there

Students have a big advantage over older people, because they have a better intuition about which markets are likely to start growing rapidly

## Sequoia seven question

- The Engineering Question: Can you create breakthrough technology instead of incremental improvements?

- The Timing Question: Is now the right time to start your particular business?

- The Monopoly Question: Are you starting with a big share of a small market?

- The People Question: Do you have the right team?

- The Distribution Question: Do you have a way not just to create but deliver your product?

- The Durability Question: Will your market position be defensible 10 and 20 years into the future?

- The Secret Question: Have you identified a unique opportunity that others donâ€™t see?

> Good startup ideas are always easy to explain and very easy to understand, if it takes more than a sentence to explain, it's a sign that is too complicated 

Most people think first of **what they want to express or make, then find the audience for their idea.** You must work the **opposite angle, thinking first of the public.**

You need to keep **your focus** on their **changing needs**, the **trends** that are going through them. Beginning with their **demand**, you create the **appropriate supply.**

> ðŸš¨ Students usually don't take care about the market they first pay attention on the product itself

## Product

* Build something users love
* Talk to users

It's better to build something that a small amount of users love then a large number of users that don't love

> The simpler win, the greate product win, it forces you to build the core extremelly well

## Manual

Recruiting my hand. In the beginning, you don't need a lot of feedback about the product, you just need some engaged users who will be able to give some daily feedback. This will be important to increment your idea
