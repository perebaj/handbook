# [Interfaces - Russ Cox](https://research.swtch.com/interfaces)

Go's interfaces let you use [**duck typing**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duck_typing).

    if it walks like a duck and it quacks like a duck, then it must be a duck

**With duck typing and object is of a given type if is has all emthods and properties required by that type**

Errors of wrong signatures and types in the **same moment that you are coding** not only in the **compile time**

Obs: There is a lot of low level information, but just the beginning of the article it's enough to get a big picture of: What is an Interface?
