The most famous UX problem in cryptocurrency is that cryptocurrency’s “defining” feature — self-custody of funds — is incredibly difficult to use. Users constantly lose their wallet secret keys, and with them access to all of their funds. This problem is endemic even to sophisticated first-world cryptocurrency adopters who have access to bank safety-deposit boxes and dedicated hardware wallets. This is going to be an even more serious problem for a cryptocurrency that purports to be the global “universal basic income” for billions of people who lack those resources.

## What other privacy concerns are there?
Another obvious concern is that Tools for Humanity could use its biometric database as a kind of “stone soup” to build a future (and more privacy-invasive) biometric database, which could then be deployed for applications that have nothing to do with cryptocurrency. For example, an obvious application would be to record and authorize credit for customers who lack government-issued ID. This is the kind of thing I can see Silicon Valley VC investors getting very excited over.
