- Develop a habit of working on your projects.

- Find gaps, our brain is a little lazy and always will push ourselves for the easiest work. 
    > Write the story you want to read; build the tool you want to use.
- Try lots of things, meet lots of people, read lots of books, ask lots of questions. 

- Great work happens by focusing consistently on something you're genuinely interested in.

- if you don't try to be the best, you won't even be good.

-  So just do the work and your identity will take care of itself.

- be honest and admit that you're mistaken.

- informality, 

- If you actually want to discover new things, it's better to take the risk of telling people your ideas.
