# Wireguard

Even though WireGuard is a cutting-edge VPN solution, I will try to bring some core concepts of networking that are independent of any tunneling solution. The idea isn't a deep dive into WireGuard, but try to cover your reason for existence and how it works.

## Introduction

WireGuard is next **next-generation secure network tunneling solution**. Created to replace IPSec and OpenVPN. Cutting-edge cryptography ensures the security and authenticity of your data.

## Tunneling protocol

Tunneling is a **communication protocol**, that ensures that an amount of data will be sent from one destination to another. It can, for example, allow private network communication across a public network, through a process called encapsulation.
