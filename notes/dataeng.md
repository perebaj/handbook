# Data Engineering

IMO, Data Engineering is just a sub-topic behind software development, but with a focus on data. When I started to perceive that my skills were too focused on this field, I started to stay worried. This isn't a way that I want to track my career, but is the way that the industry wants!

Creating commodities upon developers' experience it's a good approach for the industry, with that, you can reduce the salaries and hire more people and fast. For me, this isn't the way, my way is being close to the wide range of software development approaches and having contact with all things that I can.

But yep, I need to remember some data engineering concepts, and here is the place that I will put them.
