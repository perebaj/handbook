# JJ Style guide

## Introduction

This is a style guide for my projects. It's a work-in-progress project, and I will keep updating it as I learn new things.

For now, this style won't be contemplated for deep topics, just simple notes about setup, configuration, and other things that I consider important for [greenfield projects.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenfield_project)
