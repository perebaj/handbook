# Quantum Computing

Just gathering some basic concepts about quantum computing

# Recap

According to how computers evolved, they started to become smaller and more powerful, in the sense that the same volume of hardware could calculate more and more operations, and computer parts started to reach the size of an atom.

A computer nowadays could be summarized as the following components, main memory, arithmetic unity, and control unity, those components are made of circuit chips which in turn are arithmetic models(sum, multiplication, division, and so on), which in turn, are logic gates that are made of transistors.

Transistors are responsible for controlling pieces of information signals, energic pulses, which we call bits, basically an energy representation that computers understand. Combinations of several bits are used to build complex structures, being able to build phrases, and even write a text using your computers.

Today the typical size of a transistor is something like 14nm, which is 8 times less that the HIV virus and 500x times smaller than an human blood cells. This basically means that we are facing some phisical barriers to achive more powerfull transitors, because their size starts to get a really small size, the workaround to continuing the evolution of computing: Quantum Computing

## qubits

Multiple states

### Superposition

Unlike bits act like a switch, meaning that their value could be **zero or one**, quantum bits act in a different way, they could represent a mix of these two values at same time, creating a new landscape in computer field.

Visualy, could be represented as something like that:

- entanglement
- interference
