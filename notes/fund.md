# [What Investors Look for in a Startup Founders from Former YC Partner](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cDCl4cS5xY&ab_channel=JomaTech)

What is more important?

- Grit around iteration: Just make something and iterate on it. Even if it sucks!
- Shockingly Simple: Just build and show up to people.

1. What is it?
2. Who's it for?
3. What problem does it solve?
4. Does it solve it well?

Why does a startup fail?

- Cofounder problems
    - Prefer teams that already build something together(Camping example)

Six decades into the computer revolution, four decades since the invention of the microprocessor, and two decades into the rise of the modern Internet, all of the technology required to transform industries through software finally works and can be widely delivered at global scale.

Just be CLEAR and Concise!

- I don't need to do all the work

```txt
probably the biggest thing people don't undestand about the process is the importance of express youself clearly.
```

Investors will ask themselves and verify if you know the following:

- Do I understand the idea?
- Am I excited about the idea?
- Do I like the team

- Talk with enthusiasm
- How to make it easy to understand?
    - Make it legible
    - Make it simple
    - Make it obvious

```txt
Legible slides are ones that even old people in the back rows with bad eyesight can read.

Should be understandable by people who don't know nothing about the idea or the topic.
```

- Things to AVOID:
    - Ambiguity
    - Complexity
    - Mistery
    - Ignorable (Idle talk)

- NOUNS
    - What are you making?
    - What is the problem?
    - Who is the customer?

## Example

```txt
Airbnb is the first online marketplace that lets travelers book rooms with locals, rather than hotels.

Dropbox synchronizes files across your/your tem's devices.
```

- LEAD with WHAT not WHY or HOW
- PLEASE BE CONSISE
