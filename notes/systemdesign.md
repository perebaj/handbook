# Client Server model

A very basic approach to understanding it is trying to comprehend what happens when we try to access some URL in our browser.

Basically, every URL it's a map for an IP address, and our browser is responsible for making this whole process happen.

Each IP address has a lot of ports, that represent am apartment in a building. And you can expose in each of these ports a different program.

Usually, the ports that public services use are:

- https: port 443
- http: port 80

Besides that, we have the client and the server. To components that establish connections to send and receive data.

Usually, the client is the browser, the user or someone else that is trying to access something, on the other hand, the server is the machine that has the data, and it's responsible for sending it back to the client.
