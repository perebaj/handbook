# Frontend

Most of my ideas and personal projects don't have a fancy frontend. Since I started to code, I've been more interested in AI, Big Data and backend stuff. But, as the same way that I'm focused to recap some [DS&A concepts](../dsa/), I think that is a good opportunity to learn more about frontend development.

So here I will try to keep a list of topics that I want to learn and some resources that I'm using to do that.
