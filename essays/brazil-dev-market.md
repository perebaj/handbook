# Brazil Dev Market

There is no doubt that Brazil exports a lot of skilled engineers abroad, the herd as usually, are just normal guys, who got out of the university, found good opportunities and started to work in the local market. What I will try to tease here, is just a futuristic idea, using as examples the market in other countries, and try to show how Brazil will tend toward the same path.

First, the market will always get more and more tough. With the adventure of AI, competitive market, and huge salaries, companies will start to get more skeptical about who is the better one to hire. And obviously, the tendency is that the normal developers will go to the end of the stack. But why I'm saying that?

Recently I was fired, and I felt that I'm a strong employee, with good hard and soft skills, formed with a good score in a recognized university, and with a good experience in the market. Because of that, I decided to try foreign opportunities, and to my surprise, this shit is hard as fu*k and I'm not prepared, I take +- 4 mouths to perceive that.

To be well prepared, you need to be good at English. Basic, pass a good image about yourself and your work, and do that in a language that you don't have a full domain, probably take you away from the ultimate goal. Secondly, the really good companies, that pay huge salaries, have a hard interview process, they are not dumb to just trust in your words, that you are good enough, that you will work hard and do the right things, they need to create some mechanisms that will make them lose the minimum amount of money as possible and at the same time, choose the best one. Unfortunately, those who created this game of interview process were the Big Techs, and this phrase summarizes everything.

```txt
leetcode or die
```


- Leetcode will define how good you are at work, no!
- Leetcode will define if you are a good engineer, probably not!

But unfortunately, they will use it as a metric. The companies don't have time to take a look at your side projects, and your Github, and make sure that you document, test, and take care of your code, pretty fair, I completely understand that. And as soon you start to understand that, you will start to study hard, and try to be good at the requirements that the market is asking for.

In the end of the day, we, as developers know that Leetcode doesn't define how good you are, but you aren't trying to prove that for yourself or a friend, it's a company on the other side, offering 300k a year, and they need to be sure that you are not a liar, a framework user, or even a copy paste developer.

# Now about the Brazilian Market

We as Brazilians, know that isn't a usual way to metrify the skill of a developer applying some algorithm questions, usually if you have good conversation skills, and a good resume, you are hired. But, as the market gets more and more competitive(**especially now**),


## Conclusion

Don't believe in someone who doesn't achieve the same level that you are looking for. If you want to work in a good position in a good company, look what the guys that are occupying this chair did to get there, and try to do the same. I have SURE, that was a combination of time, effort and a lot of study/hard work.

Don't piss of about a result that you don't put the effort to get it. Remember that it takes time and patience to get what you want, you just need one yes.

Don't put all of your coins in a company or someone, put your coins in yourself, and be always prepared for the worst and the best situations. If you are working, try to evaluate your skills by scheduling some interviews, building some side projects, and trying to increase your network. This will help you when some disaster happens, and you need to find a new job.



- I see a movement of companies to hire Brazillian engineers to work from Brazil to abroad companies
The best-prepared engineer in those topics above are North Americans, Europeans, and Asians
- The abroad market, already have the mindset/culture. You have to be good at leetcode to be hired, and as we export every single aspect of the culture, thinking that we are doing the best job, problaby, soon, the local market will be inflamated with this mindset.
