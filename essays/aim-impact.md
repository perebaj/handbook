# Aim Impact

After changing my work environment I noticed that companies always are looking for people that already had resposability for delivering results, specifically startups. When you have a narrow team, money and time to ship a product, you need to have people that will assume the responsibility to to roll up their sleeves and help the business to grow. For this reason, I have been very critical in choosing projects and people to work with, because depending on the environment, I can through my career in the trash and the next steps will be very hard to achieve, more dedication now, more easy will be in the future.

Having this critical sence now, it's being so helpful because I'm noticing the amount of opportunities that I can ambrace just being an interested guy and showing that I have energy and curiosity to learn.

Some initiatives that I'm doing:

- Heard more REAL people and try to make a connection with them, friends or just workmates.
- Implementing my own projects and showing that for my friends.
- Participating in hackathons and meetups.

Those things, bright the eyes of the people that are looking for engaged people to help their business and consequently, I'm hopping that will get more opportunities.
