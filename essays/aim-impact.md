# Aim Impact

Companies always are looking for people that already delivered results, specifically startups. When you have a narrow team, money and time to ship a product. Have people that will roll up their sleeves and help the business to grow, those are the best ones.

For this reason, have been critical about your career, projects, and people to work with, it's your duty. Because, depending on the environment, you can through your career on the trash. Or simply take more time to achieve your goals.

Some good initiatives to start, are:

- heard the ones that achieve something nice, try to copy their steps;

- build your own things;

- take part in events. Meetups, hackathons and open source projects.

Those things brighten the eyes of companies who are looking for engaged people. Remember, be awesome just for you, it's not enough, you should show it. The best way to address it is to think about it and put some energy.

If you are working in some company, try to write down what you are doing, and what needles you are moving. The initiatives that you are commanding. And be always aware of the market. There are a lot of good opportunities out there, but they are looking for the ones that know how to sell them.
