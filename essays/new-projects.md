I already heard that all engineers like to start a new project and always avoid working on old ones, I think this because is hugely hard to understand a third project, in a magic world all the code will be well documented, will exist the backlogs, architectural design, easy to test, find logs, manage infrastructure, but this type of maturity is really hard to achieve.

When I started to study how to organize this topic and create a mental model around the above subjects, was tough to understand that essays, speeches, books, and other knowledge channels won't give me the awareness that I'm looking for.

So, what I can do to improve myself and be confident to talk about engineering? I'm pushing myself to avoid tooling.

```
The conceptual knowledge is more important that tooling.

When I ask myself: If I start a project using a cloud environment, a simple API, or a backend application, what is the right way to start? Or, If I put my hands on a third project, what are the expectations, in my head if I don't have these concerns well-structured I'm never will be the engineer that I expected to be.
