# Annoying

In a shared environment it's easy to have different personalities and archetypes of people and companies, they could fit or not with your current mental mood, but the question is, when they don't fit with you, how to deal with that? Sometimes you will have an annoying teacher, leader, or a company that won't match your principles, that's life.

In my short life experiences, I'm already had to deal with this type of person/institution, and I really consider myself a polite and chill guy, so, I don't try to find troubles or confront someone, but this is related to my personality, I know people that don't accept "to take insults home", and they are right, anyone deserve to be disrespected, in particular, in the professional context.

But my conclusion about this behavior is very clear, this tells more about the people/institution than you, and in my humble opinion is always related that the people/institutions are suffering pressure or some insecurity, for this reason, choose the right leaders is the core duty of the most RH and companies mission.

So, my tip here is, if you face some guy or company that is annoying to you or your teammate, document it and try to not reproduce the same. Try to take a position where you don't lose your reason, be polite, and if the temperature soars, tell your leader, C-level, someone who could help you and you trust. But keep in mind, nobody one deserves that, and it's not normal don't feel free and your work setting.
