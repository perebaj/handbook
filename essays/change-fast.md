## Human Being

Have you already asked yourself how older the human being is? 

This was a skeptical question that I made for myself when I was knowing different cultures, that are older than the ones that we have in Brazil, and the answer to this question triggered a fractal reasoning in my mind. And I will try to put my thoughts here!ðŸ¥¸

In the end, the sensation that I always have is that we have a particularly short time, if we compare the time with the time A.C., the sample space is like 2000 years, but about the cavemen? It's like 400.000 years! The time that the social contract started is dated like 5000 years before Christ. This means that the humans, the environment, and the way that we are organized are minuscule compared to the total.
