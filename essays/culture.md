# Culture

So, I really share the same vision with some guys that I considered the magicians of software development,,and in the last few years, I've been consuming their content, and based on that I can feel that they have some practices in common, so here I will try to share in my words/experience, the things that I could perceive that leverage the environment and engineer self-esteem in place that I worked for.

**Internal OpenSource** 

Yes, if you want an engaged team, I think that one of the steps to achieve it is using documentation built by its own team, to craft future projects and new solutions. 
New architecture service? Document it!
A new approach to dealing with logs/tracing/metrics? Document it! 
Bugs in production that take your entire Friday night? Document it!

This will be useful for guys that will come in the future and for their own team, it's really beautiful to see a nice code base, but before it, it's tons of beauty to see documentation that was discussed and approved by everyone.

**Code Review, testing and how easy is it to ship code in production?**
Yes, I think that's a "well-worn phrase". But that it's it! Maybe this could sound odd in environments that never paid due attention to tests and reviews, but I have already seen projects that just died because of the lack of these practices.


**Feedback Culture**

Will be possible for a new guy to have contact with the CTO of the company? The CEO? I'm looking for knowledge, this drives my career and ambitions, and I feel that this type of behavior in a company environment also leverages the: "I think I can dream big with these guys" and I think that the only way to achieve it, it's admiring the people you are with every day. So, make yourself comfortable to just speak and share what you are wondering with anyone, for me, it's essential!

This also includes feedback in general, talk about things that you disagree with and things that excite you!
