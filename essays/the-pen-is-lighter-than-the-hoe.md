Before I started to be a person that loves to learn things, I remember my father saying the phrase, the pen is lighter than the hoe. That summarizes a lot of things. But after the entire university, and studying for consecutive years, I have strong opinions that surround the learning and studying process.

What I want to tease here, is the capitalist pressure in your head and social behavior.

When I was young, I do not have the practice to talk to other people and the ability to pay attention to others realities otherwise mine, I do not blame myself for that, but I know that was a process, and this takes time.

Aside from my experience, when I have contact with other realities, was a culture shock for me, people from all states of Brazil coming to SÃ£o Paulo trying to study and improve their lives. I was blessed because my fathers spend all his forces to give me a structure to change the city and live in a safe place, eating well, and just focus on university. When I said blessed, is a heads or tails game, anyone before the entrance exam, says to me, the difficulty to live away from your parents and the cost involved in this process. Many other young gems with the same background come to the city for just study, what differs between these fellas, is a lot, but here I want to focus on purchasing power.

How does the State think a 17/18 year old is going to live far from his city and family?

This is an important question that must be answered because the State is assuming that your family has the power to sustain you away from them.

How does the State think a person that finished the course will start their life without help?
