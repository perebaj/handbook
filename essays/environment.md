Environment

It is indispensable that the environment would be friendly to new developers, mainly seniors. It's normal that people that are already working on a way or project, remain making the same mistakes, it's hard to get a zoom out or accept a third opinion about your work, on one hand,  new developers often think that everything is on a deep swamp, while on the other hand, the old developers may think that things are going well. In my opinion, both are right. (kkcrying)
However, when advocating for new members with fresh experiences and ensuring the company fully utilizes their skills, it is important to create an environment conducive to sharing their value.

Let's think about a use case. Imagine that all company is saving secrets using plain text into your git, any developer knows that this is the worst practice ever, but to ship things as soon as possible, everyone does that way. It's ok, happens...
When the new guy sees that, I do not doubt that the first action is to change this shit for a new approach.

What I want to highlight here is the following: if you don't have the freedom to address fundamental issues like this, and you simply add experienced developers to the same environment you already have, you may end up with similar results."
