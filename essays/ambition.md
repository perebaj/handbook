# Ambition

I don't know too much about life and I have a lot of things to discover, but I'm trying to put some effort into that.

I will try to explain that effort around the word `ambition`. I am just 23 and always I feel confused about what is the right path for me and if need to focus on new challenges, discover new places, force myself to earn a lot of money, move to another country, learn new languages, improve my spirituality, study more, ready a book per day, things like that. kkkk

To be honest, today, the thing that most fills me is talking and learning with different people, observing them, and making reflections on them.
Today, I also understand that the pillars of human beings are three, independent of the people.
There are:

- To Wonder
- Happiness
- To live

But for my frustration it's impossible to achieve all of them at the same time, I have to admit for myself that some dreams will not be possible until my death, it's life, it's the good and bad parts to be alive.  

Should I redirect my efforts away from material pursuits and focus on spiritual ones? If I acknowledge that it's impossible, should I simply disregard these principles and move on with life?
I don't think so!

For now, it's my mental model, I want to achieve more and more, also knowing that is impossible be aware of all of them at the same time.
