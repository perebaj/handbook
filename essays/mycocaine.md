# Goals

I've been working as a developer for the past 4 years, and it's easy to perceive some patterns here(in this world).

- Frameworks
- Languages
- Tools
- Companies

All of it, it's bullshit, noise and crap. At the end of the day, what really matters is the problem you're solving. This should be your focus your, goal, your cocaine.

I'm not saying that you shouldn't learn new things, they are very important to understand the world where you are inside. But, don't let them be your goal.

It's the same for love, money, fame, etc. AWAYS will have someone out there who will have more than you, and you will be always looking for the next thing. This is a never-ending cycle. This will never make you happy and fill your soul.

Have this in mind!
