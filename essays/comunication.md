# Comunication

Engineer it's a language, nothing more than that! 

When you know someone who talks about topics in a neat way, you feel compelled to believe, agree, or even listen attentively to each detail, this guy could be just a scammer, but in the end, you judge the book by cover.

Today I was preoccupied thoughtfully with the question: What is an engineer?

And for me, the answer is simple, this doesn't mean that it is easy! You spend years studying tools, and strict methodologies, not because in the end you should be able to apply the whole thing in a company, in your daily life, or even for personal goals. You spend this amount of time, trying to solve the following question: 

Are you able, using these tools/protocols and laws, to solve this specific problem and at the same time correlate it with different fields?

If the answer is yes, then you could say that you understand the game!

But this could sound menacing at the same time, but to talk about a topic in a structured way, without losing the rationale, it's extremely hard, so, only someone, with an utterly deep understanding of the field, will be able to do that. 

And, What was the tool that was used to prove this proficiency? The clear communication!
