# Influence

Could shiny ideas be built from the vacuum? I don't think so, but in my head, this is not a verdict, it's like a mix of good taste and great influence, all mixed up with a little sauce of dedication and time. I became interested in this topic after reading Great Thinkers (that IMO is not a good scientific example, but is good enough), so, this book brings a lot of guys that were a reference in some topics, like, Philosophy, Politics, Sociology, Psychology and also Literature, and for me, it's clear that most of them, had like an addiction to find answers about some specific things, but all of them was influenced by someone, they were able to understand and to weave clear opinions on top some subjects and also remodel it.
But in the end, is it just it? "Be brave and persistent, and the path to success will be written by God?" I don't think so, but, I have a strong feeling that it's here that the Good taste comes in
