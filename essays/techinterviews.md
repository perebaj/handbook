# Why tech interviews are so hard?

Even being in contact with technologies, implementation, and design of different systems, I have to say that tech interviews are hard. Not only for the interviewer but also for the interviewed.

- How did you put the knowledge of both parts to be tested?
- How do you know if the person is good enough for the job?
- How do you know if the person is not going to be a problem for the team?
- How do you know if the person is going to be a good fit for the company?

A lot of questions, and isn't easy to answer them. But let's try to think.

First, I don't know if you could prepare yourself for a tech interview, for high roles, like senior and so on, it's a mix of all harded work that you put in your career, being contrasted against you, so, for this reason, it's easy to fail and seems like a complete disaster/foolish guy.

Secondly, you will face a problem that at least for me is one of my principal weaknesses, [Rhetoric](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhetoric), you don't need to know all the details about engineering, but you need to know how to sell yourself, show that you are the best option, confident, and that you already face similar problems, and was able to deal with them.

Here are some personal tips that I could capture on this journey by doing 3/4 interviews per week:

# Take care

I have this opinion in mind, but I could be wrong.

In the end, engineering teams should not be created to sound fancy, where everyone is happy, dealing with simple tasks, in an environment where you never will be contrasted about your skills, just accepting tasks and pushing them to production.

Engineering teams should be created to serve! Engineering is a study area created for that, transcript customers' opinions into lines of code and well-designed architectures. And however interesting this sounds, it is permeated by a LOT of issues, crapy and frustrating situations. That is life!

And why I'm saying that? As we know, **software is eating the world**, and if you want to be outstanding in the market herd, you should be aggressive, and the, engineers, marketing team, C-levels, and all the others should have this mindset, or, probably you will fail.

For this reason, if the company tries to sell them as a global hub, inclusive, product-first, that supports course platforms and so on, take care! They are not selling a **good engineering environment**, but an environment that sounds good for every person on earth. It's great to hear that but trust me, you want to hear the deepest and swamp things about the engineering, and if they aren't able to pass this for you, probably they don't have the criticism that you are looking for to improve your career.

# Imagined you on the other side

Always is a good practice, when you face a problem, put yourself on the other side of the table, and imagine yourself as an interviewer.

You probably will try to hire the most skilled guy, who will be able to do the right job, help the team, and be loyal to the company and the culture, so, practice a good pitch, there is a lot of content in the internet/youtube videos, think that you are seeling a startup idea.

# Try to find similar things between the interviewers

Dude, you are talking with people, people like receptivity, be kind, and try to dig into the life of the interviewers, doing that, they will look to you with more proximity. Hence, the probability of success will increase.

# Don't judge a book by its cover

This should be true, but isn't! People look for appearance, the way that you talk, the car that you drive, the brand of the clothes that you wear. It's terrible. I know! But as soon as you understand that, better!

So, you need to have a good look!

# The Market

Even everyone saying that the tech market is hot, and this is true, find good companies that will push your career to the moon, and give you a really good benefit and remuneration, it's hard, they will probably try to omit the really good salary, with fancy benefits, like a day off in your birthday, courses, English classes, and so on, pure bullshit, what you want is money, and a good environment, where you can work a lot without noise.

The best companies are the Big Techs or startups that receive a huge amount of money, they know that to attract the best ones, they need to be aggressive, and if you want to surf in that tide, prepare yourself a lot.

# Salary range

Just put your salary range to the moon if you are in a comfortable situation, otherwise you are dumb. I'm saying that, because I did this move, based on the "market talk", and looking a step back, I was stupid.
