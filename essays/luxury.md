# Luxury

The term "Luxus" was related in the past to excess, indulgence, and extravagance, nowadays, this word has a different meaning, used to connotate something expensive, opulent, and with high-quality

It's about the first etymology meaning that I will try to make some reflections here, I will try to expose some authors that already talk about it and also expose some empirical experiences that I already had.

The luxury bothers me! I'm already writing about this, but here I will try to go deeper than the other texts. Rousseau tries to debate this topic in two of his books, named, Discourse on the Arts and Sciences and Discourse on Inequality, luxury here, is a key point in the breakup between good and bad man, accordingly him, this was one of the aspects that collaborated with the dissimulation of virtues, models of costumes
