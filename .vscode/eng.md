Engineering

As time went by I began to realize that engineering is not about solving specific things or striving to discover or study the most sophisticated tools in the world, at the beginning of my engineering journey I was convinced that this was the way to go, but as time went by of time I started to build other mental models. So maybe what I really like is feeling that I'm involved in projects and that my presence is important.
In these 3 years of Birdie, I could feel it, in the development of the product from the beginning, getting investment and having participation in the company.

That in itself was an extensive journey, with several problems that we didn't know how to solve, and barriers that I faced along the way, at first I thought I would never be able to, but as time went by, I've only been pleasantly surprised
