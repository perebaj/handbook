# Briefing

We want to package technology and engineering solutions for factories into a single product that can be easily integrated into any production environment and deployed in factories of various sizes and sectors.

# What do you do?

We monitor factories to increase management efficiency, reduce costs, and ensure production reliability.

# How big is the market?

Our focus is on the secondary sector of industry (industrial parks), specifically factories dedicated to transforming raw materials into products. This includes sectors such as:

- Automotive, naval, and aerospace
- Metallurgical and steel
- Textile
- Food and beverages
- Paper and pulp
- Wood and furniture
- Chemical and petrochemical
- Machinery
- Construction

We know this sector is one of the most important for the economy because it is where raw materials are transformed into final products, which is the stage where the greatest value is added to the final result.

Today, the Brazilian industrial park consists of over <TODO> thousand factories, which together, move more than <TODO> trillion reais per year and have a significant share in the country's GDP. Some indicators also show that medium and large-sized companies already have equipment.

We have noticed that technology and engineering solutions for industrial parks lack usability and integration. On one hand, we have hundreds of companies dedicated to building embedded systems, sensors, and IoT in general, and on the other hand, companies focused only on data processing, analysis, and maintenance order management. Our goal is to combine these two aspects into a single product, allowing factories to focus on what really matters, production.

Some data collected by institutions such as the Federation of Industries of the State of São Paulo (FIESP) show that Industry 4.0 in Brazil is still a challenge because a considerable number of companies have never heard of it. Those who have heard, for the most part, [agree that Industry 4.0 "will increase productivity" and that "it is an opportunity rather than a risk](https://www.fiesp.com.br/sicab/noticias/fiesp-identifica-desafios-da-industria-4-0-no-brasil-e-apresenta-propostas/) which means there is a huge space for adopting technologies that can increase efficiency and productivity in factories.

# What’s your unique insight?

We realized, by talking to companies and professionals in the industrial sector, that they feel they could be more efficient but don't know how to achieve that.

On one hand, some companies have sensing equipment but cannot extract value from this data, and on the other hand, companies have maintenance management systems but cannot integrate this data with sensor data.

Therefore, we identified two major problems:

- Inefficiency in maintenance management: We have a scenario where machines already break down and receive maintenance, but the way this process is organized provides little visibility for managers who, in turn, cannot make data-driven decisions.

- Lack of predictability: The impact of a broken machine is huge, involving the entire production chain, from delivery delays to loss of money and materials (raw materials).

For this reason, we believe that combining these two aspects, sensors and maintenance management, can provide much greater visibility for factory managers, who can then make decisions based on data rather than guesses.

In our research, we also found that the adoption of technology is desired, but at the same time, the biggest obstacle is the complexity of integration, lack of clarity in the results, and long implementation times.
