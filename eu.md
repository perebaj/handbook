Hey, I'm Jonathan, 24, from Brazil, and I started learning and working in IT when I was 14 years old. During university, I was involved in projects related to AI, Big Data, and even some crazy startup ideas. I've already graduated, and since 2019, I've been working in startup environments, dedicating myself to enhancing my engineering career.

I enjoy being in environments that promote creativity and free speech, where I can learn a lot and share ideas with my colleagues.

I consider myself, a dedicated and energetic guy, looking to collaborate with skilled and intelligent people to build exciting things together.
