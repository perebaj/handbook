TODO: Finish this course

Ideas behind to use of multiple computers connected by a network:

- parallelism
- fault tolerance
- physical

Abstractions implementations that hide distributed system complexity:

- RPC
- Threads
- Concurrency

Performance: Scalability - 2x computers -> 2x throughput -> 100x Complexity(kk)
