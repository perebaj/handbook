- offset the natural forgetness
    - Trying to remember and test yourself
- There are three ways of neural plasticity
    - 1. Streightneing of existing synapses
    - 2. Weakning of existing synapses
    - 3. Formation of new synapses
- Transform study into retention knowledge
- Alert and focused are defined by your sleep quality/normal caffeine level and hydration
- Don't be a passive participant in the learning process
- 10 minute medidation per day improve your level of focus dramatically
- Yoga nidra/nsdr = non sleep deep rest

# Tips to study better
    - Set a time to study
    - Study Alone
    - teach others in the same course
    - Managing their time
    - Elimitate distractions
    - Long term motivation
        - The students have some goal behind this hard work that they are putting
    - The study that feels challenging is the most effetive
    - Tests are one of the best way to build and retain knowledge, not just to test you.

- Te more you are tested, best is your performance over that material

Andrew shows research that exposes some students for some material. And the logic was:

Expose the students to the material 4 times and after it apply the final test
Expose the students to the material once, test the students 3 times before the final test.

The students that were exposed more to the material, felt more confident that they will perform well in the final test, the other group have the opposite feeling. But in the end. The performance was better in the second group.
