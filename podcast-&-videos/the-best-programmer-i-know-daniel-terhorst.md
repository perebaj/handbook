# Get the job done

## Build a product

- Invest in the outcome
    - code is just the means, have no emotional attachment to it!
- Study the domain
    - represent this in code
- Watch your users

    - Simplify it; elimitate it

## Solve for now

- Learn to see what is really there
    - not what you are conditioned to see
    - Develop 'first sight'
- Solve the real problem
    - not some fancy generalised version of it
- Strive for simplicity

# Choosing the right tool ...for the product. not the team!

- Teams can learn! People are smart!
