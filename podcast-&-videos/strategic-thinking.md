# Strategic Thinking

## Career and work strategic

- Trabalhar duro e esperar por um aumento é uma estratégia falha. Você precisa ser estratégico e planejar sua carreira.

Criar situações que podem impulsionar sua carreira. Cada projeto entregue, cada boa relação feita, cada skill adquirida.

Carrer Moat = Reputação + Network + Skills

Você deixa de ser só um funcionário e passa a ser um ativo da empresa. Quase que insubstituível.

Each position should give to you 3 things:

- Skills
- Relationships that you can trust
- Opportinities to create visible impact

## Financial strategic integration

It's not about what money can but, but what money can build.

Investing on skills, network and opportunities. It's not just related to spend money, but to invest and build money machines.

Money should be able to make you make decision related to impact, not to survival.

## Health of energy strategic

Health is success.

Better energy means better decisions, better relationships and fast recovery from mistakes and challenges.

## Time and focus strategic

Managing attention and impactic

productivity is not about speed, it's about leverage.

1 hours of deep work is better than 10 hours of shallow work.

Think in focus like a laser beam, when it's focused, it can cut through steel, otherwise, it's just a light.

    - Protect it
    - Remove distractions
    - Create triggers to start and stop

## Creativity and inovation strategic
