# GopherCon Brasil 2024

Such a great event!

Some topics that caught my attention:

- How you can use Go to create software for embedded systems, microcontrollers, and IoT devices.
- Alternatives to organize your code structure. (What the gopher community is doing?)
- Solve live streaming problems using Golang
- Profiling and benchmarking, for sure will leverage your engineering skills. (pprof and benchmark)
- Good insights about how to build search engines using Go.
- Concurrency patterns.
- ORMs. One of the best presentations. It depends... but it's good to know the options.
- How to work in open-source projects and receive for that. (Google Summer code, lfx mentorship, etc.)
- Slog standard library.

# [Building Efficient Search Systems in Go: From Simplicity to Global Scale](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1dXz_5VfOIh4KCyGZFKBkxKIv2XegCcrWYaFrWkp06yY/edit#slide=id.g2cefe3728a2_0_35)

In fact, this was one of the best presentations because it was easy to understand where I can apply this knowledge in my routine or if in a future project, I need to build a search engine.

# [How to structure a Golang project](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1x8zym2J6q8blkdmOrc-nOGu4hkyW0DCcEZ-sLBKX6tA/edit#slide=id.g1f20d11cc68_0_1470)

K.I.S.S - Keep it simple stupid

Steve Francia, Ex-Google/Golang team, all the repositories that this guy built have the same pattern, it less folders, so it is less headache to manage. Example [Cobra cli](https://github.com/spf13/cobra)

- The best reference for your Golang project is the Golang standard library, because different than the other languages, go just use itself to build the language.

# [Choosing or not an ORM](https://speakerdeck.com/andreiacsilva/escolhendo-ou-nao-o-melhor-orm-para-o-seu-projeto?slide=36)

Here is the BEST lesson learned: It always depends, but the outstanding engineer knows how to sell it using metrics and benchmarks.
