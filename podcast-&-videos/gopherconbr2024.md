# GopherCon Brasil 2024

Such a great event!

Some topics that caught my attention:

- How you can use Go to create software for embedded systems, microcontrollers, and IoT devices.
- Alternatives to organize your code structure. (What the gopher community is doing?)
- Solve live streaming problems using Golang
- Profiling and benchmarking, for sure will leverage your engineering skills. (pprof and benchmark)
- Good insights about how to build search engines using Go.
- Concurrency patterns.
- ORMs. One of the best presentations. It depends... but it's good to know the options.
- How to work in open-source projects and receive for that. (Google Summer code, lfx mentorship, etc.)
