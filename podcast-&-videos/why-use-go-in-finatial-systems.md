# [Why use GO in financial systems - Cassio](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzQZwwkeg8Q)

# Why?

First go isn't a hipster language, a lot of industries are using it, in diverse fields because it's simple, it's easy to circumvent parallelism problems and when we are talking about working with distributed systems and multiple people touch all day long the same code, it's really easy to maintain.

## Procedural

Isn't a language oriented to objects and it's not functional, IT'S PROCEDURAL. What does it mean?

TODO

### Have polimosfism (Interfaces)

### Strongly and statically typed

It's really good to use it in systems that need to be really assertive in the data that you are working with and sharing with other systems.

### Garbage collector

Problems that C and C++ have, with the memory leak that was circumvented by future languages like LISP are also implemented in Go, so, you have excellent memory management!

### Compiled language

You don't need to wait for a coffee and a sandwich to compile your code, it just produces a once binary that you can put in a container and that is it!

### It's was created for the software that we are using today.

Today the software processes a lot of data, you need to have integrations with other systems and services, and you need to keep the ability to scale them without losing the performance.

### No exceptions

You can deal with the error of each function of your code, this gives you the ability to improve the control of your code.

### If you want someone

Go isn't a language that is taught in the universities, so, the programmers that have an interest to learn it, were able to learn by themselves, and probably they have the same perception that I have about the software that we are building and using today. **All things are related to Big Data, Cloud Computing or AI**, and what do these things have in common? **They are using distributed systems to deal with the data and process it!****

### Standard library

Decrease the number of dependencies that you need to start to push your code to the production environment. In this way, you have less probability of having security problems or even a lack of consistency, because all of these libraries are maintained by the same team that is maintaining the language.
