# Handbook or My mind

As the name suggests, this is my mind, then, here I usually write some notes about things that I'm studying or thinking about,  usually it's something related to computer science.

For being my Mind, some topics are not finished, organized, or even correct, but I'm working on them. You could find a lot of noise on the information/content, but I get in touch with my computer all day long, in the same way, that I need to bear up my wondering.

So, here you can find a living documentation of my engineering career
