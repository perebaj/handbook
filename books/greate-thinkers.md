- What is life and how can I achieve happiness;
- Think more, is the only way to deal with life
- Love
- Religion

One thing that I perceived from reading the biography of these philosophers, is that the major of them comes from rich families and they had, depending on the epoch that they live, important roles in politics, that way, make sense how your ideas were spread across in an epoch that the communication was limited

How did Plato propose to make people more satisfied? He builds four principles:

Think More:
Love more wisely:
The importance of beauty:
Changing the society:
