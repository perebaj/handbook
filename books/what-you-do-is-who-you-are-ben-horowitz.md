"A cultura é aquilo que você recompensa ou aquilo que você proibe"

## Introduction

```txt
The culture of a company is what your coworker do when you are not there. It's the way that they behave when you are not watching, and the path that they choose when they have to make a decision.
```

The author gives some examples of some companies in the 90s that have a great culture, between them, the ones that catch my attention are:

### FairChild Semiconductor (1960s):

The company has the mentality of "Get the barriers out of the way and let people do the things they do well". This creates a new culture, a culture of innovation, everyone was in charge. If a researcher had an idea, he could pursue it for a year before anyone would start inquiring about results. Employees were encouraged to take risks and companies like Raytheon Semiconductor, Signetics, General Microelectronics, Intersil, Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), and Qualidyne were founded by former Fairchild employees.

### Wikipedia

When it was created, the idea that the public could edit the content that talks about any subject was a crazy idea. Why not trust in the PhD to write the content? Today Wikipedia is considered a unique source of information and the most complete encyclopedia in the world.

### Intel

Founded by Gordon Moore, the coiner of Moore's Law and Robert Noyce(CEO of the fairChild), they followed a different approach to spread the culture across the company, including the culture that instigates innovation, Noyve took his ideas to a new level. Everyone worked in one big room with partitions separating them, There was no layer of vice presidents and directors, and Noyce gave the engineers substantial stock options, this guarantee that they acted like owners and kept the culture of innovation.


In the end, the companies that punish failure will never innovate, if everyone thought like that, silicon valley would never exist, because that, was where the idea of failing to build something new was born.

    Virtues and values are not the same thing. Virtues are the things that you do, and values are the things that you believe.

### Objective of the book/author

The book will take you on a journey through culture, from ancient to modern. Along the way, you will learn how to answer a question fundamental to any organization: who are we? A simple-seeming question that’s not simple at all. Because who you are is how people talk about you when you’re not around. How do you treat your customers? Are you there for people in a pinch? Can you be trusted?

Who you are is not the values you list on the wall. It’s not what you say at an all-hands. It’s not your marketing campaign. It’s not even what you believe.

It’s what you do. What you do is who you are. This book aims to help you do the things you need to do so you can be who you want to be.

## Culture and Revolution: The Story of Toussaint Louverture

### Introduction

### Who was the Toussaint Louverture?

- Born in 1743, in the French colony of Saint-Domingue, now Haiti.
- He spent his free time reading and learning, including Julius Cesar's Commentaries and Abbé Raynal's History of the Two Indies.
- He was liberated in 1776 because their owner recognized that he was a smart guy.
- He start to perceive that what made the behavior of their brothers and sisters wasn't related to the color of their skin, but the culture that they absorbed. He start, for example to buy slaves for your own, and give them freedom.

```
“A courageous chief only is wanted. Where is he, that great man whom Nature owes to her vexed, oppressed, and tormented children? Where is he?”
```

### Louverture Rise

The fight was against the French, that was facing some problems with the [revolution in France](https://www.britannica.com/event/French-Revolution/Events-of-1789), what opened some opportunities for contries like Spanish and Englang to try to take the control of the island. In the begining, Louverture combine forces with the Spanish, but after some time, he realized that we was also the same behavior of the French, and two other fights were started and won by Louverture.

### How Louverture reprogrammed slave culture

Basically, change the culture of group that already exists, isn't an easy task, but Louverture, use some strategies to do that, he permeated in the culture that already exists, like religion and cults, to change the way that the slaves think about the world.

We also build a group of the most skilled guys, and give them the training to be leaders and fighters, they also use some combat techniques that always surprise the enemies, like use the jungle to hide and attack, using Voodoo signs to communicate over the closest forests.

### Creating Shocking Rules

Louverture created a rule that was very shocking for the team, the rule was that the slaves could not have other relations if it wasn't with their wives. If you can't control your oath, how can you control a whole community?

### Incorporating outside Leadership

Using outside leaders to help build your own culture could sound like a bad idea, but Louverture uses the French and Spanish leaders, keeping their roles, but now obeying him. He just uses the figure of the leader, in that way, the others who already follow the leader will keep following him. (Julius Cesar technique)

### Make decisions that demonstrate cultural priorities

Simple like that, make you the example if you want your partners will follow you.

### Walk the Talk

If you are the ruler, you need to act like one.

### What happened to Louverture?

Louveture was betrayed by her "hand"(Dessalines), which unified forces with the French(Napoleon), this was after Louveture wrote the constitution of the island. But Dessalines perceived that the French were trying to take control of the island again, and different from Louverture, he was a little more radical, and he killed all the French on the island. The island was named Haiti, and the Haitian people were responsible for paying a huge amount of money to the French, a debt that was responsible for keeping the country in poverty for a long time.

## Toussant Louverture Applied

### Creating Shocking Rules

* It must be memorable. If people forget the rules, they forget the culture.
* It must raise the question “Why?” Your rule should be so bizarre and shocking that everybody who hears it is compelled to ask, “Are you serious?”
* Its cultural impact must be straightforward. The answer to the “Why?” must clearly explain the cultural concept.
* People must encounter the rule almost daily. If your incredibly memorable rule applies only to situations people face once a year, it’s irrelevant.


### Amazon Rule

No PowerPoint presentations. If you want to show something, write a document and share it with the team, before the meeting everything should be aware of the content and start to discuss on top of it.

### Facebook Rules

- Move fast and break things


### Incorporate outside leadership

I've already faced this in my work environment, in truth, it's always annoying was a new leader comes, specially when the team isn't performing well, because this new leader will try to change everything, something it's the right thing to do, but my only concern is that leader should be careful to not create problems with the team.

## The Way of the Warrior
This chapter summarizes the rules and culture of the samurais, they were a very respected group in Japan that followed some important requisites that made them recognized for their veracity and honor.

The Hagakure group always done to die on the battlefield, for this reason, they always are prepared to die, with the head shaved, nails cut and so on

They follow some virtues that guide the way that they understand the world and live their lives, some of them are:

- Honor: Without honor, you are nothing
- Politeness(Polidez/Boas maneiras): The way that you act with others
- Veracity or Sincerity: You are acting in that way because you belive in it.

They develop and refine their culture continuously over a very long period, using defined and specific rules to guide the behavior of their followers.

About conversations: Don't have a guide because you will pay more attention to the next questions instead of trying to capture some reasoning lack or connect the answers in a different chain of thoughts.
