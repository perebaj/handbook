## Introduction

```txt
The culture of a company is what your coworker do when you are not there. It's the way that they behave when you are not watching, and the path that they choose when they have to make a decision.
```

The author give some examples about some companies in the 90s that have a great culture, between them, the ones that catch my atttentions are:

### FairChild Semiconductor (1960s):

The company have the mentality of "Get the barriers out of the way and let people do the things they do well". This create a new culture, a culture of innovation, everyone was in charge. If a researcher had an idea, he could pursue it for a year before anyone would start inquiring about results. Employees were encouraged to take risks and companies like, Raytheon Semiconductor, Signetics, General Microelectronics, Intersil, Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), and Qualidyne were founded by former Fairchild employees.

### Wikipedia

When it was created, the idea that the public could edit the content that talk about any subject was a crazy ideai. Why not trust in the PhD to write the content? Today Wikipedia is considered a unique source of information and the most complete encyclopedia in the world.

### Intel

Founded by Gordon Moore, the coiner of Moore's Law and Robert Noyce(CEO of the fairChild), they followed a different approach to spread the culture across the company, including the culture that instigate innovation, Noyve took his ideas to a new level. Everyone worked in one big room with parittions separation them, There was no layer of vice presidents and directors, and Noyce gave the engineer substantial stock options, this garantee that they act like owners and keep the culture of innovation.


In the end, the companies that punish failure, will never innovate, if everyone think like that, the silicon valley would never exist, because there, was where the idea of failing to build something new was born.

    Virtues and values are not the same thing. Virtues are the things that you do, and values are the things that you believe.

### Objetive of the book/author

```
The book will take you on a journey through culture, from ancient to modern. Along the way, you will learn how to answer a question fundamental to any organization: who are we? A simple-seeming question that’s not simple at all. Because who you are is how people talk about you when you’re not around. How do you treat your customers? Are you there for people in a pinch? Can you be trusted?

Who you are is not the values you list on the wall. It’s not what you say at an all-hands. It’s not your marketing campaign. It’s not even what you believe.

It’s what you do. What you do is who you are. This book aims to help you do the things you need to do so you can be who you want to be.
