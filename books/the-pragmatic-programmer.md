## The pragmatic philosophy

Topic 1: It's your life

Assuma as rédeas, analise tudo com muito cuidado, é a sua vida.

Topic 2: The cat ate my source code

Bro, talk yo shit!

Quando estiver assumindo responsábilidades, tente ser o mais detalhista possível. Ser assertivo nas respostas e tentar dar alternativas para as indagações feitas. As vezes a única forma de encontrar as respostas é lendo o source code, sim, é horrível, mas são tantas variáveis repassadas de pessoa para pessoa, que muitas vezes é isso que devemos fazer.

Topic 3; Software Entropy

- Entropy
- Broken window teory
- Hopelssness can be contagious
    - Fix each one as sson as it is discovered


Topic 4: Stone Soup and Boiled Frogs

- Eventually, everyone wins
- Start-up fatigue: The point where the team is so tired that they can't see the light at the end of the tunnel
    - The solution: Try to cook a stone soup. Start putting a small amount of carots, after that, ask for potatoes, and so on.

- The Boiled frogs: Se você colocar um sapo para cozinhar e ir aumentando a temperatura aos poucos, no final ele vai acabar cozida sem ao menos perceber o que aconteceu com ele.


Topic 5: Good-enough software

- If your users are happy enough, you're done.
- Involve everyone in the process and in the tradeoffs
- Most of users prefer rough edges today than wait a year for the shiny
- Know when stops

Topic 6: Your knowledge portfolio

- Your ability to learn is the most important skill you have
- Managing your knowledge portifolio is similar to managing your financial portifolio
    - Inveting is habit
    - Diversification is the key to long-term success
    - Smart investors balance their portifolios between conservative, high-risk, and speculative investments
    - Buy low and sell high
    - Review and rebalance your portifolio periodically
- Goals
    - learn at least one new language every year
    - Read a technical book each quarter
    - Read nontechnical books too
    - Take classes
    - Participate in local user groups

Topic 7 - Communicate

- Make it look good
    - Your ideas are important. They deserve a good-looking vehicle to convey them to your audience.
- Choose the right moment
    - Ask for a salary raise when you're boss isn't in a good mood doesn't seem to be a good idea.
- Plan what you want to say. Write it down helps a lot.
- Involve your audience
    - Public documents and public thread always help to involve everyone.
- Write documentation to avoid duplicate work and be assertive about tough decisions that were made. (I usually like to do this using github and github discussions to straighten the communication between the team).
