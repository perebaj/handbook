## The pragmatic philosophy

Topic 1: It's your life

Take ownership of your ideas, analyze everything very carefully, it's your life.

Topic 2: The cat ate my source code

Bro, talk yo shit!

When taking on responsibilities, try to be as detailed as possible. Be assertive in your answers and try to provide alternatives to the questions asked. Sometimes the only way to find the answers is by reading the source code. Yes, it's horrible, but there are so many variables passed from person to person that often that's what we should do.

Topic 3; Software Entropy

- Entropy
- Broken window teory
- Hopelssness can be contagious
    - Fix each one as sson as it is discovered


Topic 4: Stone Soup and Boiled Frogs

- Eventually, everyone wins
- Start-up fatigue: The point where the team is so tired that they can't see the light at the end of the tunnel
    - The solution: Try to cook a stone soup. Start putting a small amount of carots, after that, ask for potatoes, and so on.

- The Boiled frogs: If you put a frog to cook and gradually increase the temperature, in the end it will end up cooked without even realizing what happened to it.

Topic 5: Good-enough software

- If your users are happy enough, you're done.
- Involve everyone in the process and in the tradeoffs
- Most of users prefer rough edges today than wait a year for the shiny
- Know when stops

Topic 6: Your knowledge portfolio

- Your ability to learn is the most important skill you have
- Managing your knowledge portifolio is similar to managing your financial portifolio
    - Inveting is habit
    - Diversification is the key to long-term success
    - Smart investors balance their portifolios between conservative, high-risk, and speculative investments
    - Buy low and sell high
    - Review and rebalance your portifolio periodically
- Goals
    - learn at least one new language every year
    - Read a technical book each quarter
    - Read nontechnical books too
    - Take classes
    - Participate in local user groups

Topic 7 - Communicate

- Make it look good
    - Your ideas are important. They deserve a good-looking vehicle to convey them to your audience.
- Choose the right moment
    - Ask for a salary raise when you're boss isn't in a good mood doesn't seem to be a good idea.
- Plan what you want to say. Write it down helps a lot.
- Involve your audience
    - Public documents and public thread always help to involve everyone.
- Write documentation to avoid duplicate work and be assertive about tough decisions that were made. (I usually like to do this using github and github discussions to straighten the communication between the team).
